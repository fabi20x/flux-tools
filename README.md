# flux-tools

The FToolBox allows you to easily manage all your nodes within one app and let's you execute a 1 click setup as well as manual SSH commands.
You just need to download the FToolBox_flux.exe - the rest of the files is just for updating purpose.

If update does not work automatically on start, please download latest version manually.
